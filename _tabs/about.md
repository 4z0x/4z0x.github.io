My background is in offensive security, with a focus on hardware exploitation and a foundation in traditional cybersecurity. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of low-level security challenges and learn from the systems I’ve analyzed.

I enjoy being part of the cybersecurity community, whether through playing CTFs and building hands-on hardware security challenges, or sharing what I’ve learned at conferences and workshops.
